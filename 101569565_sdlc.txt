The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic process that guides
software teams through the stages of building and maintaining software applications.
DevOps has become an integral part of the modern SDLC, transforming how teams
collaborate, automate, and deliver value to end users continuously and efficiently.

DevOps enhances each stage of the SDLC through automation and collaboration:
- Planning: Agile methodologies align teams around shared sprint goals
- Development: Branching strategies keep code organized and conflict-free
- Testing: Automated pipelines run tests on every single code commit
- Delivery: CD pipelines push validated releases to production seamlessly
- Operations: Monitoring tools provide real-time insights into system health

The measurable impact of DevOps on the SDLC is well documented across the industry:
- Teams deploying with DevOps release updates up to 200 times more frequently
- Mean time to recover from failures drops significantly with automated rollback tools
- Automated testing reduces the number of bugs reaching production by up to 50 percent
- Cross-functional collaboration leads to faster decision making and fewer bottlenecks
