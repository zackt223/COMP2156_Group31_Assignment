The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a framework that defines the process
of planning, creating, testing, and deploying software applications.
DevOps has become a critical component of the modern SDLC, enabling teams to
deliver software continuously and with greater reliability than traditional methods.


DevOps integrates into every phase of the SDLC:
- Plan: Teams use agile boards and sprint planning to align goals
- Code: Version control ensures all changes are tracked and reversible
- Build: Automated build tools compile and package code consistently
- Test: Automated test suites catch bugs before they reach production
- Deploy: CI/CD pipelines release software automatically and safely
- Monitor: Real-time monitoring tools detect and alert teams to issues
