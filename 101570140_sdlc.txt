Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) are the backbone of DevOps in the SDLC.
CI ensures every code change is automatically built and tested upon commit.
CD ensures that passing builds are automatically deployed to staging or production.
Together they eliminate manual handoffs and dramatically reduce the risk of release failures.
