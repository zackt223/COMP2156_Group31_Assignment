The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is the process software teams follow
to plan, develop, test, and release software in a structured and repeatable way.
DevOps has revolutionized the SDLC by introducing automation and continuous delivery
at every stage, replacing slow and manual processes with fast and reliable pipelines.
